# [Drawing the Power of Christ into our Lives](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives?lang=eng)
President Russell M. Nelson, April 2017

*The gospel of Jesus Christ is filled with His power, which is available to every earnestly seeking daughter or son of God*

## How can we draw into our lives the power of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ?

#### Learn of Him

We begin by learning about Him. “It is impossible for [us] to be saved in ignorance.” ([Doctrine and Covenants 131:6](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6#5)) The more we know about the Savior’s ministry and mission ([Doctrine and Covenants 76:40-41](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.40-41#40))—the more we understand His doctrine ([2 Nephi 31:2-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.2-21#2)) and what He did for us—the more we know that He can provide the power that we need for our lives.

As Latter-day Saints, we refer to His mission as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which made resurrection a reality for all and made eternal life possible for those who repent of their sins and receive and keep essential ordinances and covenants.

It is doctrinally incomplete to speak of the Lord’s atoning sacrifice by shortcut phrases, such as “the Atonement” or “the enabling power of the Atonement” or “applying the Atonement” or “being strengthened by the Atonement.” These expressions present a real risk of misdirecting faith by treating the event as if it had living existence and capabilities independent of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.

Under the Father’s great eternal plan, it is the Savior who suffered. It is the Savior who broke the bands of death. It is the Savior who paid the price for our sins and transgressions and blots them out on condition of our repentance. It is the Savior who delivers us from physical and spiritual death.

There is no amorphous entity called “the Atonement” upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such as Atonement and Resurrection describe what the Savior did, according to the Father’s plan, so that we may live with hope in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come. The Savior’s atoning sacrifice—the central act of all human history—is best understood and appreciated when we expressly and clearly connect it to Him.

The importance of the Savior’s mission was emphasized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who declared emphatically that “the fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”([Teachings of the Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, Chapter 3](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-3?lang=eng#p18))

It was this very statement of the Prophet that provided the incentive for 15 prophets, seers, and revelators to issue and sign their testimony to commemorate the 2,000th anniversary of the Lord’s birth. That historic testimony is titled “The Living Christ.”([Ensign, April 2000](https://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/04/the-living-christ-the-testimony-of-the-apostles-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng)) Many members have memorized its truths. Others barely know of its existence. As you seek to learn more about Jesus Christ, I urge you to study “The Living Christ.”

#### Have faith in Him and follow Him

As we invest time in learning about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice, we are drawn to participate in another key element to accessing His power: we choose to have faith in Him and follow Him.

True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world. They are undaunted, devoted, and courageous. I learned of such disciples during a recent assignment in Mexico, where I met with government officials as well as leaders of other religious denominations. Each thanked me for our members’ heroic and successful efforts to protect and preserve strong marriages and families in their country.

There is nothing easy or automatic about becoming such powerful disciples. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in every thought.([Heleman 8:15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/8.15#14)) But when we do, our doubts and fears flee. ([Doctrine and Covenants 6:36](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36#36))

Faith in Jesus Christ propels us to do things we otherwise would not do. Faith that motivates us to action gives us more access to His power.

#### Make and keep sacred covenants

We also increase the Savior’s power in our lives when we make sacred covenants and keep those covenants with precision. Our covenants bind us to Him and give us godly power. As faithful disciples, we repent and follow Him into the waters of baptism. We walk along the covenant path to receive other essential ordinances. ([Doctrine and Covenants 59:9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9#9), [Doctrine and Covenants 124:39-42](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.39-42#39)) And gratefully, God’s plan provides for those blessings to be extended to ancestors who died without an opportunity to obtain them during their mortal lives. ([Doctrine and Covenants 124:29-32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.29-32#29))

Covenant-keeping men and women seek for ways to keep themselves unspotted from the world so there will be nothing blocking their access to the Savior’s power. One faithful wife and mother wrote this recently: “These are troubled and perilous times. How blessed we are to have the increased knowledge of the plan of salvation and the inspired guidance from loving prophets, apostles, and leaders to help us sail these stormy seas safely. We stopped our habit of turning on the radio in the morning. Instead, we now listen to a general conference talk on our mobile phones every morning as we prepare ourselves for another day.”

#### Reach up to Him in faith

Do you remember the biblical story of the woman who suffered for 12 years with a debilitating problem? ([Luke 8:43-44](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/8.43-44#43)) She exercised great faith in the Savior, exclaiming, “If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.” ([Mark 5:28](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/5.28#28))

This faithful, focused woman needed to stretch as far as she could to access His power. Her physical stretching was symbolic of her spiritual stretching.

Many of us have cried out from the depths of our hearts a variation of this woman’s words: “If I could spiritually stretch enough to draw the Savior’s power into my life, I would know how to handle my heart-wrenching situation. I would know what to do. And I would have the power to do it.”

When you reach up for the Lord’s power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the Savior knows you truly want to reach up to Him—when He can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw His power into your life—you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you should do. ([Doctrine and Covenants 88:63](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63#63))

# [Our Good Shepherd](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd?lang=eng)
Elder Dale G. Renlund

*Jesus Christ, our Good Shepherd, finds joy in seeing His diseased sheep progress toward healing*

## Sin and those who sin

We get a glimpse into our Heavenly Father’s character as we recognize the immense compassion He has for sinners and appreciate the distinction He makes between sin and those who sin. This glimpse helps us have a more “correct [understanding of] his character, perfections, and attributes” and is foundational to exercising faith in Him and in His Son, Jesus Christ. The Savior’s compassion in the face of our imperfections draws us toward Him and motivates us in our repeated struggles to repent and emulate Him. As we become more like Him, we learn to treat others as He does, regardless of any outward characteristic or behavior.

- Story from Les Misérables

Since God uses disease as a metaphor for sin throughout the scriptures, it is reasonable to ask, “How does Jesus Christ react when faced with our metaphorical diseases—our sins?” After all, the Savior said that He “cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance”; ([Doctrine and Covenants 1:31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31?lang=eng#30)) so how can He look at us, imperfect as we are, without recoiling in horror and disgust?

The answer is simple and clear. As the Good Shepherd, ([John 10: 11,14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.11,14?lang=eng#10)) Jesus Christ views disease in His sheep as a condition that needs treatment, care, and compassion. This shepherd, our Good Shepherd, finds joy in seeing His diseased sheep progress toward healing.

# [Becoming a Disciple of Our Lord Jesus Christ](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ?lang=eng)
Elder Robert D. Hales

*The constellation of characteristics that result from faith in Christ are all necessary to our standing strong in these last days*

What does it mean to be a disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ? A disciple is one who has been baptized and is willing to take upon him or her the name of the Savior and follow Him. A disciple strives to become as He is by keeping His commandments in mortality, much the same as an apprentice seeks to become like his or her master.

Many people hear the word disciple and think it means only “follower.” But genuine discipleship is a state of being. This suggests more than studying and applying a list of individual attributes. Disciples live so that the characteristics of Christ are woven into the fiber of their beings, as into a spiritual tapestry.

As you can see, weaving the spiritual tapestry of personal discipleship requires more than a single thread. In the Savior’s day, there were many who claimed to be righteous in one or another aspect of their lives. They practiced what I have called selective obedience. For example, they kept the commandment to refrain from work on the Sabbath yet criticized the Savior for healing on that holy day. ([Luke 13:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/13.14?lang=eng#13)). They gave alms to the poor but offered only their excess—what they did not need for themselves ([Luke 21:4]( https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/21.4?lang=eng#3)). They fasted but only with long faces ([Matthew 6:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.16?lang=eng#15)). They prayed but only to be seen of men ([Matthew 6:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.5?lang=eng#4)) Jesus said, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.” ([Joseph Smith History](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#18)) Such men and women may focus on mastering a specific attribute or action but do not necessarily become as He is in their hearts.

Of these, Jesus declared: “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” ([Matthew 7:22-23](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.22-23?lang=eng#21))

Brothers and sisters, now more than ever, we cannot be a “part-time disciple”! We cannot be a disciple on just one point of doctrine or another. The constellation of characteristics that result from faith in Christ—including the ones we have talked about today—are all necessary to our standing strong in these last days.

As we earnestly strive to be true disciples of Jesus Christ, these characteristics will be interwoven, added upon, and interactively strengthened in us. There will be no disparity between the kindness we show our enemies and the kindness we bestow on our friends. We will be as honest when no one is looking as when others are watching. We will be as devoted to God in the public square as we are in our private closet.

I testify that everyone can be a disciple of the Savior. Discipleship is not constrained by age, gender, ethnic origin, or calling. Through our individual discipleship, we, as Latter-day Saints, build up a collective strength to bless our brothers and sisters throughout the world. Now is the time to recommit ourselves to being His disciples with all diligence.

Brothers and sisters, we are all called to be disciples of our Savior. Let this conference be your opportunity to “begin as in times of old, and come unto [Him] with all your heart.” ([Mormon 9:27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.27?lang=eng#26)) This is His Church. I bear my special witness that He lives. May He bless us in our eternal quest to become devoted and valiant disciples. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
