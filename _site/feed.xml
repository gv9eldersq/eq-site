&lt;p&gt;What a glorious privilege it has been to celebrate Easter with you on this Sunday of general conference! Nothing could be more fitting than to commemorate the most important event that ever occurred on this earth by worshipping the most important being who ever walked this earth. In this, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we worship Him who commenced His infinite Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was willing to suffer for the sins and weaknesses of each of us, which suffering caused Him “to bleed at every pore.” He was crucified on Calvary’s cross and rose the third day as the first resurrected being of our Heavenly Father’s children. I love Him and testify that He lives! It is He who leads and guides His Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without our Redeemer’s infinite Atonement, not one of us would have hope of ever returning to our Heavenly Father. Without His Resurrection, death would be the end. Our Savior’s Atonement made eternal life a possibility and immortality a reality for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lord-wants-to-make-his-will-known&quot;&gt;The Lord Wants to Make His Will Known&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these blessings has come as a result of seeking and heeding the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Said President Lorenzo Snow, “This is the grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint … that it is our right to have the manifestations of the Spirit every day of our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things the Spirit has repeatedly impressed upon my mind since my new calling as President of the Church is how willing the Lord is to reveal His mind and will. The privilege of receiving revelation is one of the greatest gifts of God to His children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lord-will-assist-us&quot;&gt;The Lord Will Assist Us&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the manifestations of the Holy Ghost, the Lord will assist us in all our righteous pursuits. I remember in an operating room, I have stood over a patient—unsure how to perform an unprecedented procedure—and experienced the Holy Ghost diagramming the technique in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of us have had experiences with the sweet power of prayer. One of mine was shared with a stake patriarch from southern Utah. I first met him in my medical office more than 40 years ago, during the early pioneering days of surgery of the heart. This saintly soul suffered much because of a failing heart. He pleaded for help, thinking that his condition resulted from a damaged but repairable valve in his heart.
Extensive evaluation revealed that he had two faulty valves. While one could be helped surgically, the other could not. Thus, an operation was not advised. He received this news with deep disappointment.
Subsequent visits ended with the same advice. Finally, in desperation, he spoke to me with considerable emotion: “Dr. Nelson, I have prayed for help and have been directed to you. The Lord will not reveal to me how to repair that second valve, but He can reveal it to you. Your mind is so prepared. If you will operate upon me, the Lord will make it known to you what to do. Please perform the operation that I need, and pray for the help that you need.”
His great faith had a profound effect upon me. How could I turn him away again? Following a fervent prayer together, I agreed to try. In preparing for that fateful day, I prayed over and over again, but still did not know what to do for his leaking tricuspid valve. Even as the operation commenced, my assistant asked, “What are you going to do for that?”
I said, “I do not know.”
We began the operation. After relieving the obstruction of the first valve, we exposed the second valve. We found it to be intact but so badly dilated that it could no longer function as it should. While examining this valve, a message was distinctly impressed upon my mind: Reduce the circumference of the ring. I announced that message to my assistant. “The valve tissue will be sufficient if we can effectively reduce the ring toward its normal size.”
But how? We could not apply a belt as one would use to tighten the waist of oversized trousers. We could not squeeze with a strap as one would cinch a saddle on a horse. Then a picture came vividly to my mind, showing how stitches could be placed—to make a pleat here and a tuck there—to accomplish the desired objective. I still remember that mental image—complete with dotted lines where sutures should be placed. The repair was completed as diagrammed in my mind. We tested the valve and found the leak to be reduced remarkably. My assistant said, “It’s a miracle.”
I responded, “It’s an answer to prayer.”
The patient’s recovery was rapid and his relief gratifying. Not only was he helped in a marvelous way, but surgical help for other people with similar problems had become a possibility. I take no credit. Praise goes to this faithful patriarch and to God, who answered our prayers. This faithful man lived for many more years and has since gone to his eternal glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-can-pray-for-revelation&quot;&gt;We Can Pray for Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, I prayed daily for revelation and gave thanks to the Lord every time He spoke to my heart and mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the miracle of it! Whatever our Church calling, we can pray to our Heavenly Father and receive guidance and direction, be warned about dangers and distractions, and be enabled to accomplish things we simply could not do on our own. If we will truly receive the Holy Ghost and learn to discern and understand His promptings, we will be guided in matters large and small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-church-of-jesus-christ-is-led-by-revelation&quot;&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ is Led by Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I recently faced the daunting task of choosing two counselors, I wondered how I could possibly choose just two from twelve men whom I love and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I know that good inspiration is based upon good information, I prayerfully met one-on-one with each Apostle. I then sequestered myself in a private room in the temple and sought the Lord’s will. I testify that the Lord instructed me to select President Dallin H. Oaks and President Henry B. Eyring to serve as my counselors in the First Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In like manner, I testify that the Lord inspired the call of Elder Gerrit W. Gong and Elder Ulisses Soares to be ordained as His Apostles. I and we welcome them to this unique brotherhood of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we convene as a Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, our meeting rooms become rooms of revelation. The Spirit is palpably present. As we wrestle with complex matters, a thrilling process unfolds as each Apostle freely expresses his thoughts and point of view. Though we may differ in our initial perspectives, the love we feel for each other is constant. Our unity helps us to discern the Lord’s will for His Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our meetings, the majority never rules! We listen prayerfully to one another and talk with each other until we are united. Then when we have reached complete accord, the unifying influence of the Holy Ghost is spine-tingling! We experience what the Prophet Joseph Smith knew when he taught, “By union of feeling we obtain power with God.” No member of the First Presidency or Quorum of the Twelve would ever leave decisions for the Lord’s Church to his own best judgment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-can-find-answers-to-our-questions-through-revelation&quot;&gt;We Can Find Answers to Our Questions Through Revelation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, how can we become the men and women—the Christlike servants—the Lord needs us to be? How can we find answers to questions that perplex us? If Joseph Smith’s transcendent experience in the Sacred Grove teaches us anything, it is that the heavens are open and that God speaks to His children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet Joseph Smith set a pattern for us to follow in resolving our questions. Drawn to the promise of James that if we lack wisdom we may ask of God,8 the boy Joseph took his question directly to Heavenly Father. He sought personal revelation, and his seeking opened this last dispensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In like manner, what will your seeking open for you? What wisdom do you lack? What do you feel an urgent need to know or understand? Follow the example of the Prophet Joseph. Find a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknesses—yes, the very longings of your heart. And then listen! Write the thoughts that come to your mind. Record your feelings and follow through with actions that you are prompted to take. As you repeat this process day after day, month after month, year after year, you will “grow into the principle of revelation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does God really want to speak to you? Yes! “As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course… as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to wonder about what is true. You do not have to wonder whom you can safely trust. Through personal revelation, you can receive your own witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, that Joseph Smith is a prophet, and that this is the Lord’s Church. Regardless of what others may say or do, no one can ever take away a witness borne to your heart and mind about what is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-admonition-from-our-prophet&quot;&gt;An Admonition from Our Prophet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge you to stretch beyond your current spiritual ability to receive personal revelation, for the Lord has promised that “if thou shalt [seek], thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, there is so much more that your Father in Heaven wants you to know. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, “To those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, it is clear that the Father and the Son are giving away the secrets of the universe!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing opens the heavens quite like the combination of increased purity, exact obedience, earnest seeking, daily feasting on the words of Christ in the Book of Mormon, and regular time committed to temple and family history work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there may be times when you feel as though the heavens are closed. But I promise that as you continue to be obedient, expressing gratitude for every blessing the Lord gives you, and as you patiently honor the Lord’s timetable, you will be given the knowledge and understanding you seek. Every blessing the Lord has for you—even miracles—will follow. That is what personal revelation will do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am optimistic about the future. It will be filled with opportunities for each of us to progress, contribute, and take the gospel to every corner of the earth. But I am also not naive about the days ahead. We live in a world that is complex and increasingly contentious. The constant availability of social media and a 24-hour news cycle bombard us with relentless messages. If we are to have any hope of sifting through the myriad of voices and the philosophies of men that attack truth, we must learn to receive revelation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, will perform some of His mightiest works between now and when He comes again. We will see miraculous indications that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, preside over this Church in majesty and glory. But in coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My beloved brothers and sisters, I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation. Let this Easter Sunday be a defining moment in your life. Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Moroni, I exhort you on this Easter Sabbath to “come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift,” beginning with the gift of the Holy Ghost, which gift can and will change your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-special-witness&quot;&gt;A Special Witness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are followers of Jesus Christ. The most important truth the Holy Ghost will ever witness to you is that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He lives! He is our Advocate with the Father, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. On this Easter Sunday, we commemorate His atoning sacrifice, His literal Resurrection, and His divinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is His Church, restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I so testify, with my expression of love for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ryan Viertel</name></author><summary type="html">The Atonement of Jesus Christ</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Yearning for Home</title><link href="rviertel.github.io/2018/03/19/lesson.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Yearning for Home" /><published>2018-03-19T13:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-03-19T13:00:00-06:00</updated><id>rviertel.github.io/2018/03/19/lesson</id><content type="html" xml:base="rviertel.github.io/2018/03/19/lesson.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-yearning-for-home&quot;&gt;A Yearning for Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_the_Wonder_Dog&quot;&gt;Bobbie the Wonder Dog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read of this powerful instinct in animals, I can’t help but wonder, “Is it possible that human beings have a similar yearning—an inner guidance system, if you will—that draws them to their heavenly home?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that every man, woman, and child has felt the call of heaven at some point in his or her life. Deep within us is a longing to somehow reach past the veil and embrace Heavenly Parents we once knew and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might suppress this yearning and deaden their souls to its call. But those who do not quench this light within themselves can embark on an incredible journey—a wondrous migration toward heavenly climes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;god-calls-to-you&quot;&gt;God Calls to You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sublime message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that God is our Father, that He cares about us, and that there is a way to return to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God calls to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God knows your every thought, your sorrows, and your greatest hopes. God knows the many times you have sought Him. The many times you have felt limitless joy. The many times you have wept in loneliness. The many times you have felt helpless, confused, or angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, no matter your history—if you have faltered, failed, feel broken, bitter, betrayed, or beaten—know that you are not alone. God still calls to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Savior extends His hand to you. And, as He did to those fishermen who stood long ago on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, with infinite love He speaks to you: “Come, follow me.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/18.22?lang=eng#21&quot;&gt;Luke 18:22&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you will hear Him, He will speak to you this very day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you walk the path of discipleship—when you move toward Heavenly Father—there is something within you that will confirm that you have heard the call of the Savior and set your heart toward the light. It will tell you that you are on the right path and that you are returning home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-life-will-be-better&quot;&gt;Your Life will be Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I testify that when we embark upon or continue the incredible journey that leads to God, our lives will be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that our lives will be free from sorrow. We all know of faithful followers of Christ who suffer tragedy and injustice—Jesus Christ Himself suffered more than anyone. Just as God makes the “sun to rise on the evil and on the good,” He also allows adversity to test the just and the unjust. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.45?lang=eng#44&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:45&lt;/a&gt;) In fact, sometimes it seems that our lives are more difficult because we are trying to live our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, following the Savior will not remove all of your trials. However, it will remove the barriers between you and the help your Heavenly Father wants to give you. God will be with you. He will direct your steps. He will walk beside you and even carry you when your need is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;god-will-use-you&quot;&gt;God Will Use You&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your journey back to Heavenly Father you will soon realize that this journey isn’t just about focusing on your own life. No, this path inevitably leads you to become a blessing in the lives of God’s other children—your brothers and sisters. And the interesting thing about the journey is that as you serve God, and as you care for and help your fellowmen, you will see great progress in your own life, in ways you could never imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-cant-get-there-on-autopilot-or-as-distracted-drivers&quot;&gt;We Can’t Get There on Autopilot (or as distracted drivers)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot just float in the waters of life and trust that the current will take you wherever you hope to be one day. Discipleship requires our willingness to swim upstream when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one else is responsible for your personal journey. The Savior will help you and prepare the way before you, but the commitment to follow Him and keep His commandments must come from you. That is your sole burden, your sole privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord has established The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help you in this commitment to serve God and fellowmen. Its purpose is to encourage, teach, lift, and inspire. This wonderful Church provides opportunities for you to exercise compassion, reach out to others, and renew and keep sacred covenants. It is designed to bless your life and improve your home, community, and nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come, join with us and trust the Lord. Lend your talents to His wonderful work. Reach out, encourage, heal, and support all who desire to feel and heed the yearning for our supernal home. Let us join together in this glorious pilgrimage to heavenly climes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gospel is a transcendent message of hope, happiness, and joy. It is the pathway that leads us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we embrace the gospel in faith and deed, each day and every hour, we will draw a little closer to our God. Our lives will be better, and the Lord will use us in remarkable ways to bless those around us and bring about His eternal purposes. Of this I testify and leave you my blessing in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ryan Viertel</name></author><summary type="html">A Yearning for Home</summary></entry></feed>
